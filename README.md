# üåê Cisco Packet Tracer Labs

This repository contains topology scenarios I have created using **Cisco Packet Tracer** to improve my computer networking skills.  
Each lab simulates a different network architecture, providing examples similar to real-world enterprise network infrastructures.

### üîπ Lab 01 - Packet Tracer Introduction

This topology demonstrates how two branches of an organization communicate securely over the Internet while being protected against potential attacks through Firewalls.

### üîπ Lab 02 - Connecting Devices
This topology demonstrates how routers can be interconnected over different distances while PCs communicate within their LANs through switches. It also highlights the proper use of cable types (straight-through, crossover, and fiber) for device connections.

### üîπ Lab 03 - OSI Model
This topology demonstrates the analysis of packet journeys across the OSI layers using Simulation Mode and the generation of Layer 7 traffic via DHCP through the IP release/renew process on PC1.

#### ‚öôÔ∏è Step-by-Step Configuration

##### 1. Switch from user EXEC mode to privileged EXEC mode. [View Image](Lab04-Basic-Device-Security/images/user-exec-to-privileged-exec.png)

##### 2. Enter global configuration mode. [View Image](Lab04-Basic-Device-Security/images/global-configuration-mode.png)

##### 3. Change device hostnames. [View Image](Lab04-Basic-Device-Security/images/change-hostname.png)

##### 4. Configure an unencrypted enable password. [View Image](Lab04-Basic-Device-Security/images/add-password-for-privileged-mode.png)

##### 5. View current configuration. [View Image](Lab04-Basic-Device-Security/images/show-running-config.png)

##### 6. Enable password encryption. [View Image](Lab04-Basic-Device-Security/images/password-encryption.png)

##### 7. View current configuration again. [View Image](Lab04-Basic-Device-Security/images/password-encryption-show-running.png)

##### 8. Configure a more secure encrypted password (enable secret). [View Image](Lab04-Basic-Device-Security/images/enable-secret.png)

##### 9. Save the configuration to startup-config. [View Image](Lab04-Basic-Device-Security/images/save-configuration.png)
