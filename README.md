# üåê Cisco Packet Tracer Labs

This repository contains topology scenarios I have created using **Cisco Packet Tracer** to improve my computer networking skills.  
Each lab simulates a different network architecture, providing examples similar to real-world enterprise network infrastructures. 

## üìÇ Contents

### üîπ Lab 01 - Packet Tracer Introduction

This topology demonstrates how two branches of an organization communicate securely over the Internet while being protected against potential attacks through Firewalls.

### üîπ Lab 02 - Connecting Devices
This topology demonstrates how routers can be interconnected over different distances while PCs communicate within their LANs through switches. It also highlights the proper use of cable types (straight-through, crossover, and fiber) for device connections.

### üîπ Lab 03 - OSI Model
This topology demonstrates the analysis of packet journeys across the OSI layers using Simulation Mode and the generation of Layer 7 traffic via DHCP through the IP release/renew process on PC1.

### üîπ Lab 04 - Basic Device Security
This lab demonstrates how to perform basic device configurations on Cisco IOS devices using the CLI.

### ‚öôÔ∏è Step-by-Step Configuration

- Switch from user EXEC mode to privileged EXEC mode. [View Image](Lab04-Basic-Device-Security/images/user-exec-to-privileged-exec.png)

- Enter global configuration mode. [View Image](Lab04-Basic-Device-Security/images/global-configuration-mode.png)

- Change device hostnames. [View Image](Lab04-Basic-Device-Security/images/change-hostname.png)

- Configure an unencrypted enable password. [View Image](Lab04-Basic-Device-Security/images/add-password-for-privileged-mode.png)

- View current configuration. [View Image](Lab04-Basic-Device-Security/images/show-running-config.png)

- Enable password encryption. [View Image](Lab04-Basic-Device-Security/images/password-encryption.png)

- View current configuration again. [View Image](Lab04-Basic-Device-Security/images/password-encryption-show-running.png)

- Configure a more secure encrypted password (enable secret). [View Image](Lab04-Basic-Device-Security/images/enable-secret.png)

- Save the configuration to startup-config. [View Image](Lab04-Basic-Device-Security/images/save-configuration.png)

### üîπ Lab 05 - Ethernet LAN Switching
This laboratory demonstrates how switches dynamically learn MAC addresses and update MAC address tables by observing ARP and ICMP traffic generated during communication between computers.

### ‚öôÔ∏è Step-by-Step Process

### 1. Initial setup
- Both switches (SW1, SW2) start with empty MAC address tables.
- All PCs (PC1, PC2, PC3, PC4) start with empty ARP tables.

### 2. Ping from PC1 to PC3
- ARP Request: PC1 broadcasts an ARP request asking "Who has 192.168.1.3?"
- All devices (PC2, PC3, PC4) receive this request.
- ARP Reply: PC3 responds with its MAC address directly to PC1.
- Once the ARP exchange is complete, ICMP Echo Request is sent from PC1 to PC3.
- PC3 responds with ICMP Echo Reply to PC1.

### 3. Learning MAC addresses
- The switches determine which MAC address is on which port by examining incoming/outgoing traffic.
- Network traffic is generated by sending pings between PC2 and PC4, ensuring that the switches learn the MAC addresses of all computers on the network.
- Thus, in subsequent packets, unicast is performed directly to the target instead of broadcast.

### 4. Removing MAC addresses

### üîπ Lab 06 - Cisco Router IP Configuration
This lab demonstrates how to configure and verify router interfaces and host IP addresses to establish end-to-end connectivity across multiple networks.

### ‚öôÔ∏è Step-by-Step Process

### 1. Check the current interface status
- Use the `show ip interface brief` command to check the status of the interfaces.
- [View Image](Lab06-Cisco-Ip-Configuration/images/display-interface-status.png)

### 2. Configure the G0/0 interface of the router with an IP address
- Enter the interface configuration mode and assign an IP address with a subnet mask.

### 3. Add a description to document the interface connection 
- [View Image](Lab06-Cisco-Ip-Configuration/images/g0-0-description-configuration.png)

### 4. Activate the interface
- By default, Cisco router interfaces are administratively **shut down** (disabled).
- To bring an interface into a working state, the `no shutdown` command is applied in a specific interface configuration mode.    
- [View Image](Lab06-Cisco-Ip-Configuration/images/g0-0-interface-activation.png)

### 5. Configure the router's G0/1 interface with an IP address, add a description to document the interface connection, and finally enable the interface.
- [View Image](Lab06-Cisco-Ip-Configuration/images/g0-1-all-ip-configuration.png)

### 6. Configure the router's G0/2 interface with an IP address, add a description to document the interface connection, and finally enable the interface.
- [View Image](Lab06-Cisco-Ip-Configuration/images/g0-2-all-ip-configuration.png)

### 7. Verify the Configuration
- Use the `show ip interface brief` command to check the status of the interfaces.
- This command displays the assigned IP addresses, the administrative status, and the protocol state.
- If both `Status` and `Protocol` are shown as **up**, the interface is working correctly.
